*   This program refeers to the Monkey's problem. It is as follows:
*   There's a bridge in the middle of the forest, and some monkeys on either side of it.
*   The monkeys eventually cross the bridge for food, and go back.   
*   The bridge can take infinite monkeys, as long as all the monkeys are going to the same side.
